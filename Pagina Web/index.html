                <p class="parrafo1">
                    A cloud named Nimbita, while traveling the world, discovered something surprising on a remote island called American Samoa: a vital secret was about to be revealed. 
                </p>

                    The ocean, a silent but powerful warrior, absorbed around 31% of the carbon dioxide (<strong>CO₂</strong>) that humans generated daily through their activities.

                <h2 class="titulo-capitulo">The Call of the Reef</h2>
                <p class="parrafo1">
                    The sea, a brave warrior, felt that over the years its task was becoming increasingly difficult. One day, it observed a group of clouds starting to cover the sky and realized that they were no longer as white as they used to be.  
                </p>
                <img src="../Video y Imagenes/Nubes.jpeg" class="story-image floating-image">
                <p>
                    Worried, it asked for help, as its only allies, the corals, showed alarming signs of environmental stress: they were starting to bleach, a clear sign that something was wrong. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The acidification, caused by excess carbon dioxide (CO₂), which the sea absorbed at around 40% of global CO₂ emissions in recent years (between 2015 and 2018), caused continuous acidification with a pH decrease of 0.0016 units per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This equates to an increase in acidity from 0.4% to 0.5% annually, contributing to the acidification of ocean waters and affecting entire ecosystems, including coral reefs that host 25% of all marine species, and reducing fish populations
                </p>
                <img src="../Video y Imagenes/Corales.jpeg" alt="Bleaching Coral Image" class="story-image">
                <p>
                    The sea, exhausted by this constant battle, saw its strength wane. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the clouds in the sky was one named Nimbita, an ally of the sea, who decided to intervene
                </p>
                <p>
                    As she moved toward the island of Samoa, she noticed a group of children playing on the beach.
                </p>
                <p>Approaching the reef, the children observed with sadness that the corals had lost their color and were much fewer than they remembered. 

                </p>
                <p>Perplexed, they turned to the approaching cloud and asked what was happening. </p>

                <h2 class="titulo-capitulo">The Storm of Knowledge</h2>
                <p class="parrafo1">
                    Nimbita, with a soft yet worried voice, explained that this was the result of a battle her friend, the sea, was losing.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "The sea has been fighting pollution for years," she told them. "CO₂, along with other gases like methane (CH₄), is causing water acidification, and the corals cannot withstand it. They are dying slowly."
                </p>
                <img src="../Video y Imagenes/Mundo.jpeg" alt="Nimbita Speaks Image" class="story-image">
                <p>
                    She spoke of the effort she made to clean the air throughout her travels around the world, but how, increasingly, the task was becoming more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The air is not as pure as it used to be," she said. "And when the air is polluted, the sea also suffers." As Nimbita recounted the story
                </p>
                <p>
                    her voice became more solemn, almost like an echo of the sea itself. She told them about the endless battle the sea was waging against CO₂, a battle of years that had left great losses in its wake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The children, moved, understood that protecting the air and the sea was vital to preserving not just the corals, but everything they loved about nature. 
                </p>
                <img src="../Video y Imagenes/NinosAyudando.jpeg" alt="Nimbita Speaks Image" class="story-image">
                <p>Nimbita mentioned that, during storms, they intensified, sea levels rose, and marine ecosystems were in danger</p>
                <p> Nimbita, together with the children, decided it was time to act. On their journey, they visited the Observatory in American Samoa, where scientists monitored the climate and the sea's health.</p>
                <p>There, they learned about the importance of research and how the collected data could help make informed decisions to protect the planet. </p>
                <p>
                    The children marveled at how scientists used advanced technology to study the sea. They mentioned that the sea acts as a carbon sink and explained that since the start of the industrial era.
                </p>
                <img src="../Video y Imagenes/Cientificos.jpeg" alt="Nimbita Speaks Image" class="story-image">
                <p>
                    the global ocean's average pH has decreased by 0.1 units, representing an increase of approximately 26% in acidity. This process of acidification adversely affects corals, mollusks, and other calcifying organisms, weakening their structures and making growth difficult. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They understood that knowledge was a powerful tool in the fight against climate change. They decided they should share what they learned with their community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Nimbita’s help, they organized workshops and activities to educate others about the importance of taking care of the air and the ocean.

                <p class="parrafo1">
                    As the children shared their message, the community began to unite.
                </p>
             
                <p>
                    They planted trees in local parks, organized beach cleanups, and promoted the use of clean energy. Nimbita's story became a symbol of hope and action.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The clouds, once seemingly forgotten, were now seen as allies in the fight for cleaner air.  
                </p>
                
                <p>Citizens began to adopt more sustainable habits, reducing the use of plastics and choosing public transport or bicycles over cars

                <img src="../Video y Imagenes/EmpezaronaAyudar.jpeg" alt="Hope Symbol Image" class="story-image floating-image">
                <p>Local initiatives flourished, and soon, the small town became an example of how collective action can make a difference.</p>
                <p>The children, alongside Nimbita, felt proud to be part of a movement bigger than themselves. </p>
                <p>Join the fight for a cleaner and healthier planet. Every action counts, from planting a tree to reducing your carbon footprint.  </p>
